This is a program for my dog. When we leave the hosue and he is in his crate he barks. 

This program will listen for an audio change, a bark, and play different mp3 files that are our voices to try and comfort him. I'm pretty sure this is cruel and he doens't like it but it kind of works.

You will need the latest version of Processing, avaialble at Processing.org. You can update the audio files inside the data folder and adjust the sketch's setup configuration.
